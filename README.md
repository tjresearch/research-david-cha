# Bot-thoven
Robot that can read MIDI file and play it on a xylophone

Install a Python IDE (eg. Pycharm), Arduino IDE, and Processing IDE for their respective files: midi reader.py, ProjectArduino.ino, and ProjectSerial.pde.

Install Mido with `pip install mido` or any other method found on https://pypi.org/project/mido/ 

Install Adafruit_PWMServo library by following instructions found on https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver/using-the-adafruit-library

Running the python file first should result in the creation of a data.txt output file which is then accessed in the Processing and Arduino IDEs.
